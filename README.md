The OSS text to speech Software
=======================
This would be a simple text processing software which translates text to Output speech using python libararies like TextBlob/pySpeech. The sole purpose of this project is to maximize learning while you develop it. Come and join in the development! *In future version we would be using NLP techniques.

Timeline
--------

The project was officially announced in the [Telegram
Group](https://t.me/joinchat/JwdGixVxr68o_dpm23KKGw) on the 25th of January 2019. It is an ongoing
project and so you can jump in any time! 

Pre-requisite
----------------

* knowledge of GitHub, not a must though you can learn basics in a couple of hours.
* Presence on Telegram Group (install telegram first if error or join from desktop )
* Dedication

Benefits
------------
* Mentorship
* Open Source Project
* Learn By Doing
* No COST
* Learning experinece for real world software development.


Why are we using certain libraries/techniques
--------

The goal of this project is to learn, we will use libraries which force
you to learn certain concepts. In all cases, we try to use minimal libraries
which don't have a lot of extra things in them instead of big ones to make the
learning elements small and clear.

 If you are joining this project midway, you can
refer to the projects to see what has happened in the past and the intentions
and motivations of earlier code.


Learning Goals
--------------

1. How to change your code as a project's needs grow.
2. How to collaborate in an open source project.
3. From simple to advanced Python programming.


How to Participate
------------------

Participation in this project has two paths. You can write code, and you can review other people's merge requests.

To write code:

1. Read the [issues](https://github.com/gauravrock/TheOSS_first/issues) in this project (Issues in the [good-first-issue] label are a good starting point).
2. If you want to work on an issue mention in the issue discussion that you want to work on it. You can collaborate with multiple people on a single issue. Make good use of github's fork and merge mechanism.
3. As soon as you have code which attempts to solve an issue, submit a merge request to the project's master branch so that others can look at it and learn from it.
4. Improve your code as per feedback until the merge request is accepted.
5. Party ðŸŽ‰

To review:

1. Pick up a merge request on the project.
2. Go through the code.
3. If something is not clear, ask for clarification. If someone has already asked just thumbs up that comment.
4. Add an approving comment saying "Good work!". If someone has already commented thumbs up on that.
